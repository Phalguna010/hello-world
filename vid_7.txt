the only reason that we even got away with it um one of the leaders in our platoon he was
the person doing the drug test so like you task leaders out with different jobs
sharp which is like sexual harassment uh assault response and prevention EO equal
opportunity um the UA which is the guy who does the drug test he could like kind of give us a hint like hey guys
clean up because in like x amount of days we're gonna do a drug test uh you know so then everyone would get
clean but then once the new leadership came in they took that responsibility from him
and then next thing you know like you know four or five of our guys are popping hot for cocaine
a lot of people did heroin and meth that was really bad i lost a lot of friends actually in the army
from overdoses from that kind of stuff more times than not like a lot of people in the military i would say more so on
the combat jobs the military police the infantry cavalry we all do steroids like
it's like so normal for us to like you know do steroids like i'm over here putting you know test and anavar trend and you
know my ass literally bending down and like no but uh everyone does it and like you know you can't you have to
specifically test for that stuff but they know like it's to get bigger and stronger so that i can go and kill the enemy
um so they didn't care too much about that but when it came to drugs itself yeah i just wanted a quick
turnaround i like did heating and air conditioning i went to technical school in high school i like got fully certified i did
that for like two or three years and then like the recession of 2008
came in i was living in a house i had these cars i lost everything so then
i like moved back in with my dad i did that for like a year i was working at putt-putt and i was making like four
dollars an hour and i just realized like this isn't really the life for me i get
like super patriotic or something in like early 2009 and then like by late
2009 that's when i like decided hey this is i'm gonna pull the trigger and join the military like join the army you know
my dad was in the army uh and did a lot of years it was like 14 years
as a tanker so i was like you know maybe i'll fall in his footsteps and and
like if i do i want to like surpass his rank so like i just want to like you know i don't
know like like be a good son or something i don't know so like i um
i was walking through the mall and like this is when they they don't do it too much anymore um but like there was a you
know recruiting station at the mall so it had like all the branches and i was getting a um
t-mobile razer phone the flip phone and it was like coolest thing to have so
like i got that and i'm like walking through and then i just see it and i was like
and my buddies like three of them joined the marines and they were still in boot camp and i was like that's what i want
to do i walked in went to the marines initially and then they all got out of boot camp
and they called me the first thing they did was call me because i was like sending them like letters and stuff like i'm gonna join the marines and they were
like dude like i got so screwed over from my recruiter like i'm doing this job that doesn't even correlate to what
i do because like you can't really pick your job in the marines like it's just what they give you is what they give you
more or less like there's some other stipulations with it but so then they were like dude go to the army so i
walked over to the army and said i want to be an engineer and they were like you know as long as you qualify and i went in and i
qualified so i became an engineer my dad like when i told him i wanted to join he
was like think about it for one month don't be so immediate with it like if you want to do this think about it for a
month and at the end of the month if you want to do this then i fully support your decision that's what i did like every day it was just
more and more and more i wanted to join the army and by the end of the month i said yes i still want to do this and
then he like you know like kind of came with me at that point and we sat down and uh
you know kind of made it happen i guess i honestly personally love being there it's where i feel
most alive things are simple like your life pretty much consists of do work
once you're off for the day like you know most people like take a shower or go to the dining facility um
you get back to your room you might talk to people on like facebook for a little uh watch a movie or like a tv show
masturbate and then go to sleep and then do the same thing all over again it was like there was like no regrets
there like i jumped out of planes i loved all of it um you know i was in strikers i did cool
striker stuff and everything i was in scout platoon doing sniper stuff and reconnaissance stuff
um you know it for me it was awesome like there were some hard times but all of it was awesome
what was it like off deployment good because i could like eat taco bell
again and i can eat all these good foods again but like you're never really the same like like a
part of you is always there like i'll always be the man in the desert like it's just like that ending scene of
uh like jarhead that that's a very real statement when you come back and you're looking in like the walmart
uh you know lot you're looking at all the cereals and stuff when you're just standing there like staring into
nothingness like that's a real thing um it's not for everybody but it does happen to a lot of people
you're never the same again like i like i'm so
empty just like i love my daughter you know i
you know i i like you know love my parents and stuff but like i don't understand it anymore
it just doesn't have a meaning to it i might cry for a day or maybe even not even that just things don't compute
because you're just broken down so much in your career the longer you go the worse it gets
um so like at the end of it you're just like this this void and some people can live through it some
people seek you know mental health like i did and then you know some people kill
themselves like it's a it's a very normal thing for us but like up you know i'll never change
what happened i think it was good for my character and for kind of the development of myself and like the
people that the lives that i've changed for the better because of it in the military
there comes a crossroads when you make a certain rank one of three things becomes
available to you when you get up to like sergeant staff sergeant so you have drill sergeant
you have recruiter and you have instructor if you become an instructor you're just teaching
new soldiers how to do the job that you do when it comes to those jobs you kind of need them to
progress even higher in rank it's called a broadening assignment you do one of
these jobs for the next you know three two to three years and
if you don't choose something the army is going to choose for you which is what happened to me
i was applying for drill sergeant and i got an email one day that said hey congratulations you have been auto
selected to be a recruiter for the army
so i i wasn't too happy about that um
so i decided like i was going to get out because it was my last year anyways so if i were to stay in i would have to be
a recruiter that's kind of how they lock you in so like if you stay in you have no choice
um so i was gonna i was like four months from getting out i talked to some friends who were recruiters
and they kind of gave me their real you know aspects about it and for me it seemed like a positive thing because it was
like the career counseling to where i could help people so i said okay you know i'll do this so i re-enlisted to stay in and i went to
recruiting school and then got my my you know place where i was gonna do recruiting at a recruiting school is six
weeks and four days of the dumbest waste of time
all it is is just regulations regulations regulations they teach you different classes
so all these different leaders would come in to teach this class or to teach this class and
each time the very first question or statement that they would come out with
is who here feels uh that they won't get promoted because
they're becoming a recruiter it made me realize like the reason they're saying that is because that's a real thing because
there's probably statistics out there that show that people who go recruiting this is what uh kills your uh ability to
progress in the military and that was actually what ended up being the case it's a career
killer for people who uh go into the recruiting deal people who uh go into the drill sergeant field
or the instructor feel like you're leading soldiers so like it just looks better on your evaluation reports that
get once a year if you are a combat job going into a non-combat related field
you have been you know off of the line which means like not doing your job for three four
years it you know they're not gonna make you the next rank
in a job that you haven't done for four years so i i did it in uh in kentucky that was
like my main area like i had like a certain city but like it was in kentucky
so like it took me like six months to get somebody in and like that's kind of like a big no-no like you have like
borders to make and all this kind of stuff so one of our recruiters this is when i first got there i was brand new i
didn't know anything about recruiting one of the guys in my office he never recruited and i didn't know why so then
after he left and you know he went to a different duty station i found out why that was
so you know he had he was a a sergeant first class
and he i'm trying to figure out the best way of
putting this like so the reason that he wasn't allowed to recruit was because he had relations
with a high school female like a 16 year old 15 year old so
when her information broke because i don't know if somebody found her they found
each other like people found them together whatever it was um i think that she came clean about it if i'm
not mistaken and she came clean about it to her parents which then you know they when they saw the text messages and the
snapchat pictures of them you know doing things or whatever and then she reaches out to the administration
and then that school administration reaches out to the fbi or something and there's an investigation because of it
you know it destroyed our relationship with that school and it took the next generation of recruiters that
came in to replace everybody you know almost two years to gain the friendship back of that school
because where i'm at is very community based everyone you know cares about each other so you
know when they see one person in uniform messing up everyone in uniform messes up the first guy that i put in
um i actually made him an airborne infantry man and come to find out that he was going to the exact unit that i
came from so he was going to know all the same leaders that i did and everything and i
remember like he had this uh he took a chainsaw to his leg on
accident he was like cutting through some wood and like took a chainsaw to his leg so he had this massive scar that
i had to like get the processing center to you know write a waiver for so that
he could join the military because you have to make sure you still have like full function and all that kind of stuff
uh but yeah he was like my first guy he was super awesome he was like 18 19
and he was actually one of the guys like our my unit was the one that you saw on
the news where uh the you know we were leaving kandahar uh
you know when biden first took over where the people were falling out of the plane and all the taliban were standing
between me and you apart and all that terrible things were happening and we left all that equipment behind he was a
part of that process so he when he came to me uh maybe like not even six eight months ago
he was a completely different person he didn't look the same he didn't act the same he had that dead inside
look that i had after my first deployment because of the things that he went through if somebody wanted to go
infantry like like i was i would actually pull them to the side and say hey look i love my job as the
infantry you know being infantry but this this is going to be your reality
there's going gonna be good days where you get to do cocaine with the boys and go do all this cool stuff
and you know get in fights and stuff like that and you have cool stories but then do you see that it's raining outside
right now you're gonna be in that you're gonna be in the mud and the dirt and it might be cool for a little bit but six
months later a year later you know do you still want to be out there freezing in in the winter time when maybe some of
your other friends who were in like the better fields of the army you know they might be able to stay inside all it
all day you know me i can kind of confront them and say hey look this is the realities on this is there good
things that can come up from the army absolutely it provided me a great light
um it's not for everybody but then you have the other side where they're like you know all your dreams can come true
and you're never gonna hold a weapon unless you want to and you know you're gonna have all these good meals
and you're gonna get like these like uh you know you're gonna be living in the the hilton express all the time and you
know so it just depends on who the person is but typically the ones who can lie like that
it will eventually come back around and though either the person won't ship
which then we get like a big smack on the hand because of it like it's always the recruiter's fault even if your
leadership pressured the kids so much to where they decided they don't want to do it anymore
it's still it's still my fault they just feed them this line of shit and sometimes it comes back around and
then sometimes it doesn't come back around we had a guy in our office who
kind of did that he would falsify things with them he was like putting in guys left and right like he was like the the
recruiter to beat essentially like you know we couldn't beat him because he was always putting people in
but then because our community is so small those kids started finding out from
those other kids who he was putting in when they got out of basic training and they were calling saying hey he screwed  
me over and then that broke out into the community you know when somebody doesn't
ship uh we call them like like a loss so that counts against you like that's a
bad thing so he started taking like four losses one month five losses the
next month four losses the next month and like that's a really bad thing to
happen for him so it's like you know he's trying to add like like why is this happening to me
when we're like dude it's because you're a piece of shit and you're lying to all these people like that's why it's happening and the thing is like when you
go to the processing station you know you're there with all the other branches when we're waiting for our
people to process we we have like a like a waiting room for the recruiters so you're in there
with marines navy air force coast guard and uh
you know you'll hear that like them saying like oh i got this guy over like you'll you'll see like the scumbags
the scumbags of the recruiting field and like typically the good ones will kind of you know keep away from them and stuff
um but you do hear it all the time and uh you know again like you'll find the good ones who say oh look i got this guy
this super cool job and that'll motivate you to kind of do the same thing or
i'm having sex with this person who i'm putting into the military and you know
hopefully i don't get them pregnant before they ship off basic training like that happens all the time too where you have sexual relation with the people
that you're putting in and let's say they have like a single mom who's like you know in her 50s or
something and she's attractive and like as soon as their son or daughter goes to basic training you're gonna start you
know having sex with their mom and stuff like that while they're gone like that happens all the time too you know it's a
bragging right for a lot of those people so they're like oh look at you know i tap that blah blah blah and drill
sergeants do the same thing it's in instructors it happens all the time that
uh relationship with high schooler things is so common
it happens everywhere with every single branch like these when you see these teachers
and stuff that have like sexual relations with these other high schoolers and stuff like
it feels like it's almost crazy to think about but then when you're like in our shoes
that's a that's a very real and kind of like easy to do thing
the people who get voluntold uh to do the recruiting stuff it's called detailed recruiting
so you do it for three years and then you go back to your normal job and you get to do your normal job
and then after a year of being a recruiter you get the option of becoming a permanent
recruiter so that's what you do for the rest of your career is permanent recruiting
so and that opens up options like you're never going to deploy again you're never going to be in the field again you're
never going to shoot your weapon again so there's like and you typically get more family time but not really um
a lot of people will go to that side and realize like once they do that
they're like a part of the fold like they're like a part of the the masonry 
they get their own set of rules that they get to do whatever they want
and the the the recruiting command is gonna take
care of them and shield them so like when people do that stuff where they touch little you know touch high
schoolers and stuff or have sex with them or um you know whatever it is
they protect them because they're a part of it but the detailed guys they treat us completely differently and they
ostracize you you know so you have a different set of standards
that the permanent guys don't have to abide by there's a lot of different avenues of
approach you can go out to like your local high school you know do your cafeteria set up you
know you put up your table and you got like cool items for people to get and like talk to different high schoolers we
would be in the office for the next portion making thousands of phone calls every single
day text messages social media um you know to get nothing essentially like
you know it's kind of hard to come to somebody and say hey do you know do you want to join the military when their college is
fully paid for and then somehow convince them that they're fully paid for college isn't worth it
and that you should come join the military and stuff um and we can do like events and stuff like
that as well but typically was a lot of phone calls and then going to high schools and like
borderline stalking these kids to try and get them to join the only ones we really care about are the juniors and
seniors that's what matters most they don't know what they want to do yet if they don't know if they want to go to
college or if they can even afford college we can do that for you the army can take care of that for you are you
going to go into college while you're in the army 90 percent i'll say no you're not going to have
the time for it um and even if you're online with it and you need
to get like a project in or something or assignment put in the leadership doesn't care if if
you need to go to the field they're gonna send you to the field regardless they don't care about your internet access
and you're in your success like they just don't because the mission always comes first
it always comes first over everything but what the military doesn't understand is the people are what makes the mission
so if you don't have the people on your side or the right motivation or mentality they're not going to be there to help
complete the mission to the effectiveness that you're looking for the big mentality with the leaders there
because like they're all like we say like they're drinking the kool-aid they're so like in this world of like
recruiting that nothing else matters to them their families don't matter nothing else matters
they want you to you know call these kids 10 12 15 times in like a
month you know again reaching out via text message somehow finding their snapchats
or their instagrams and reaching out to them there then when you find somebody who might have interest you're like
pursuing them at school like if they don't reach out to you on the text like the text message you already know what school they go to
and what teachers they have and all the administration is going to let you do whatever you want so
you know because you're wearing a uniform so i'll go find that kid and you know
try and you know not myself thankfully but there are other recruiters that like will bully
them essentially into saying okay you're gonna come to the office or you're gonna you know we're gonna talk about the military and stuff
the the leadership who's in charge of the recruiting they don't care about the recruiters
even if you are permanent or non-permanent they just treat you like so poorly all
the time because the only thing that matters is the mission the suicide rate and divorce rate is like through the
roof in terms of recruiting so like we had this instance
this leader got pushed pushed to the edge and
one morning before everyone else got into work this was in tennessee this boss of this uh recruiting station
you know got to his limit and so he pretty much went into his office one morning sat down and just
blew his brains out right in the middle of the station and uh you know killed himself and he
left behind three kids and uh the leadership at that time
like the really high up there the sergeant major especially the sergeant major like he's an absolute piece of
trash and i can talk to talk about him all day um he didn't care
he was just like okay he's dead now who's the next guy who's gonna replace him
so and he was very open about like the next day he came into their office like they're still picking brain matter off
of the wall and he's just like hey guys like i know that this happened but like you guys
still have to make the mission how do you tell somebody that even at his funeral the sergeant major showed up
and there were other civilians who used to do recruiting they retired and then they came back to
do it as a civilian that sergeant major and these these civilians were in a circle
at the funeral like the wife and the children are over there like mourning the whole family's mourning
and all he was talking to them about was who's going to be the next guy to take over his position
their leadership makes them work like seven days a week from from six o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock 11
o'clock at night so these people who have families have children they don't see them wake up they don't put them to
bed they don't go to their their baseball games and their tennis games like you know they don't see their
spouses their wives or husbands like they just don't have that luxury they just have to keep pushing to make
mission and the leadership doesn't care like they're just they're literally waiting for you to kill yourself so that they can put
the next guy into your seat and just continue pushing through you know they have the programs in place
to help the people but like at the end of the day they don't they don't care they
just okay you you had your breaking limit cool now let me grab the next guy and let's see how long this person lasts for
our systems only reflect what the army needs at that time
so if they only need infantry cook uh water purification specialist
that's what like for me i'm not gonna push you into that position because i want you to get what you what your
dreams and aspirations are but the people above me all they want to do is make that number
they have to go talk to my boss and when they sit in there they're going to say oh the infantry is just like
military intelligence here take this job and sign for four years or six years
sometimes they'll leave and sometimes they they don't leave for basic but the ones who do leave what happens they
don't like the job because that's not what they were looking for but the boss the the recruiting command you
know they don't care about that stuff they're just there to make numbers at the end of the day again it's like the mission is what
matters like the the soldiers like we don't and this is like an army-wide thing that's why you see like the things like
uh like vanessa down in fort hood where she's murdered and killed by another leader you know like that stuff is so common
and they especially fort hood they try to cover it up like they really do their best to cover up all that stuff because
you don't want to be seen in a bad light but it happens all the time so this was like maybe a few months ago maybe a year
ago now um so like she was being like sexually harassed by her leadership like this one
specific leader and she was reaching out to people saying hey he's like sexually uh
advancing towards me and harassing me again like leaders just don't care she wasn't hurt and she told like she told
that leader who was doing that hey like i'm gonna tell on you so he
bashed her over the head knocked her out dragged her into the armory which is like where we keep all of our weapons
and stuff and like proceeded to like cut her into a bunch of pieces and then put
her into a weapons case and then he like brought it home and then got his girlfriend
like they put a bunch of cement in there and then they buried her but the thing was is that fort hood
didn't do anything they just they tried to cover it up acted like it never happened and then when the family
started catching traction with like different news casting places you know they had no choice but to like start
looking for her because they didn't care they don't they weren't gonna look for her and uh you know once they found out like
oh she's buried in this freaking marshy lagoon and stuff and you know again
leadership they just do what they need to do to get to you know to the next subject like they're like okay all these like rape is
so bad in the military rapes assaults like us as recruiters
when we go through like the faxing process of like seeing who's
qualified and who's not especially on the permanent recruiter end we have so many that like like we can
find your police records of like if you've ever been charged all that kind of stuff
mental things that have been wrong with you i can find that i could find anything so there are recruiters who like
the person that they're trying to put in they know that they are
sexual assaulters they know that they're rapists they know that they're this but they take that paperwork and they put it
away and then they put in the good stuff and then now that person's in the military and what are they gonna do
they're gonna go and rape somebody else they're gonna go in and uh beat their wives or you know beat their children
and stuff but they still like they don't have an issue with that they don't care even some of the leadership
knows that they're doing that and they don't care about it because it's making that quota she sent out messages to her
family saying like hey i'm being harassed and all this kind of stuff and then like the messages just stopped
after she kind of reached out saying hey like i'm not having a good time in the military these bad things are happening
and then like she just went completely silent so they were like reaching out to her leadership saying hey like you know
where's my daughter i haven't heard from her in four or five days and the leadership just like pushed it off like
maybe she went awol like maybe she like you know ran away you know and we're not gonna
take the time and energy to like look for her we're just gonna chalk it up as a loss and like we don't care so
then like they reached up to the higher form of leadership like on fort hood so they just kept going
higher and higher you know to like you know lieutenant colonels and and generals
and none of them cared aand then once they started getting in
you know out to these newscasting places saying hey our daughter's been gone for two months can you can you get something
out there then it started catching traction you know and then like when they realized oh
something did happen and then once that news got out like the whole entire country especially in the dc area there
was a bunch of movements you know of like you know kind of like these hashtag me
too's of like trying to you know say hey look like this is a very common thing in the military like
this this happens all the time back in the day when an investigation happened we left it inside of the military so a
lieutenant or a commander would be put as like an investigator even even though that's not his job they'd make him an
investigator to prove if it was true or false and you know again if you are kind of
like in the in crowd um they would you know sweep it underneath the rug and
say oh it was inconclusive the army can kind of dictate what happens but now
because of what happened with vanessa you know now it's it's federal so now outside sources like the cia and fbi and
all that they're the ones who take control of the of what happens and uh they're the ones
who you know make sure that what's happening is really happening and stuff so it's out of the control of the military now
i'm gonna let my cat out real quick hold on two seconds two seconds
when it comes to that are you trying to get her in hold on
i mean you can literally pick her up and throw her in here she'll be fine stella
stella cell baby
hold on oh man i'm trying to like figure there's like so much information i'm
trying to remember and i just recently got out so i wasn't the best recruiter
and it was more so because i told people the truth and didn't false by things and it's kind of harder to get somebody in
when you tell so much of the truth as opposed to just kind of bluffing it for them when you don't do well for three
months straight you get three zeros in a row you get nobody in um you have to get retrained on how to
do recruiting it's a three-month course that they put you through where they
essentially run the basics uh two times so you kind of go through the same recruiting college
that i went through to become a recruiter you have to do that two more times but at your own leisure kind of so
i i didn't really care for that thought process that mentality is that you know you're just you're wasting your
resources on somebody who's getting out so when i was going through the retraining i was like you know
if i'm seven months six months from getting out of the military the main thing you
should be concentrating on is getting out of the military we have a program uh
called uh the soldier for life program which is is supposed to take a year and
they kind of teach you how to be a person again and try to help you get a job and how to like wear business suits
and all this like necessary stuff to like be a human being again we have something called like the uh
the open door policy and the open door policy is kind of like if you have an
issue that you feel needs to be resolved you can go to like the highest leaders
and kind of like convey your issues um and everything you know
more or less kind of stays within the closed doors but they they typically will resolve the issue sometimes they
don't which is why you see that the rape stuff and the killing so they just kind of sweeping if it's somebody they know
and they like they're going to sleep underneath the rug so you kind of have to be careful on who you talk to when
you use that that open door policy and said hey look i you know if i still have to do the
course at the end of this i have no problem with this it's just you know if i'm only six months from
getting out anyways you know i have to find a job i have to do this i have to make sure that i'm successful so that i
can put food on the plate you know for my child you know he came out and
literally just said like he didn't give a [ __ ] the only thing that mattered to him was completing the mission
so it's like he was like you're gonna do the course and you're gonna get something out of it and you're gonna continue to put people in until the very
last day that you're in the army because at the end of the day the army and the mission comes first over your own
personal issues of having to take care of your family you know they're going to fluff up everything that they want or
they're going to say hey look we got you your job and then they're gonna falsify your paperwork to where it shows that
you're going into military intelligence or like you're gonna be a linguist and speak like chinese
and then like on the side is like your actual documentation where like you're gonna be a cook
and like life's gonna absolutely sucks you know it's gonna suck for you for the next four years and you won't know it until you get to
basic training and then your drill sergeant tells you hey this is what your actual job is because you're [ __ ] you
i'm not trying to talk people out of the military the military can be a great thing but
people need to know the realities of what can happen what has happened and like what will
happen in the future do your research i would definitely say like
it sucks because the military mitigates so much like what jobs you're gonna get like this these are jobs you have you're
gonna have to deal with it because they're just trying to get you in but if you have the opportunity of like
really picking your job like just pushing to the aviation pushing the uavs pushing the medical um you know signals
pretty good uh what's like other like there's other good you know aspect but
if you're trying to go do like cool infantry call of duty stuff like just know like life isn't gonna be like all
like peachy for you i typically now i push people to the air force the air force even though it does
have its its negatives as well their lifestyle is like way better
and their opportunities their their uh their perks like they just they have it better
so i push them i push them there your daughter is interested in joining the military what do you tell her
um i think if it were in the future i'd have to you know
pay attention to what's going on in the world and you know because like i don't want her to like push into ukraine
you know my mentality now is kind of like you know young men young men die
to fight an old man's war and that's just that what happens nowadays we just can continue to push into these
conflicts so like i would have to see what's going on at the time and
really make sure that there's actual change that's happened in the military for the better to where it gets back to
those those those good days where people were revered um and respected so
i would give her the real spiel hey look this is the positives and negatives but understand as a woman that these are the real
tragic things that could actually happen to you if you were to push yourself into that kind of you know feel
if you could tell everybody in the world one thing what would it be oh man
that's deep um i just say like no matter how low you get like
know that people are there for you always maintain your like your your integrity for yourself like
the world is not worth you know being a liar like it's just you're gonna gain
true deep lifelong friends by maintaining your integrity like like you know your truest self
